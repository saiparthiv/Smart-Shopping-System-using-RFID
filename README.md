# Smart-Shopping-System-using-RFID
In today’s fast moving life everyone wants to do things smartly. Started from smart
phone now the era of smart shopping has come. Where customer don’t want to stay in
long queues as it takes long time at billing counter. To overcome this we have come up
with this idea of smart shopping in which on keeping the item in trolley it will scan it
throgh RFID , it takes less time than bar code scanning . All the items purchased with
it’s cost are showed on led screen simultaneously. Smart cards are used for payment
which will be recharged first before going into shopping area. At last through that card
payment is done. Help to do budget shopping with ease.

# Advantages of Smart shopping trolley are : 
1)Smart Shopping 
2)Budget Shopping
3)Reduces time by avoiding long Queues and cash payment. 
4)Safety and rack of Inventory and product details. 
5)Shopping details are kept track customer behaviour on which analysis can be done to improve shopping.

# Future Enhancements
The following up-gradations can be made in the project to make it more user friendly.
1. The future work of this project can be that all product will replace by NFC Tags
and each customers will have their own NFC reader i.e., the smart phone.
2. In which the smart phone itself scan the details and price of the product and list
out with the total amount.
3. The amount also paid by mobile itself using digital payment or NFC.
4. Data Analysis can be done on the project to predict customer shopping behaviour
and regular notifications can be given on the new products, offers.
5. Will help to keep inventory management in the stores easily.

# Conclusion
Our proposed model of Smart Shopping using RFID improves the quality of shopping
in shopping malls and helps to digitalis the business.in coming years the implementation
of such models will more increase.

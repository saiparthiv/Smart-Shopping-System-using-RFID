# Smart-Shopping-System-using-RFID
In today’s fast moving life everyone wants to do things smartly. Started from smart
phone now the era of smart shopping has come. Where customer don’t want to stay in
long queues as it takes long time at billing counter. To overcome this we have come up
with this idea of smart shopping in which on keeping the item in trolley it will scan it
through RFID , it takes less time than bar code scanning . All the items purchased with
it’s cost are showed on led screen simultaneously. Smart cards are used for payment
which will be recharged first before going into shopping area. Finally, Card payment is done through it.

# Advantages of Smart shopping trolley are : 
1. Smart Shopping 
2. Budget Shopping
3. Reduces time by avoiding long Queues and cash payment. 
4. Safety and track of Inventory and product details. 
5. Shopping details keep track of customer behaviour on which analysis can be done to improve shopping.

# Future Enhancements
The following upgradations can be made in the project to make it more user friendly.
1. In future all products could be replaced by NFC Tags and each customers will have their own NFC reader i.e., the smart phone.
2. Smart phone could be used to scan the item details and price.
3. The amount could also be paid by mobile itself using digital payment or NFC.
4. Data Analysis can be done on the project to predict customer shopping behaviour
and regular notifications can be given on the new products, offers.
5. Will help to keep inventory management in the stores easily.

# Conclusion
Our proposed model of Smart Shopping using RFID improves the quality of shopping
in shopping malls and helps to digitalize the business. In coming years the implementation
of such models will increase more thereby reducing the costs involved.
